href="https://github.com/ioam/topographica">github</a> page for
instructions on obtaining and installing current versions of
Topographica. 

<!-- CEBALERT: put this somewhere
<P>Before starting, note that if you want to run large simulations
(requiring more than about 3 GB of memory), you should install
Topographica on a 64-bit platform.

<P>Linux and Mac users can run <code>topographica -g</code> from a
terminal to start Topographica. Windows users can double click on the
Topographica icon on the desktop.

<P>Running Topographica interactively is described in detail in
the <A HREF="../User_Manual/scripts.html">User Manual</A>. If you want
to get straight into working with a full network, a good way to begin
is by working through
the <A HREF="../Tutorials/som_retinotopy.html">SOM</A>
or <A HREF="../Tutorials/lissom_oo_or.html">LISSOM</A> tutorials.

<P> Have fun with Topographica, and be sure to subscribe to
the <A HREF="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/topographica-announce">topographica-announce</A>
mailing list to hear about future updates!
